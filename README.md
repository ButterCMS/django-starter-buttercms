# Django + ButterCMS Starter Project

Live demo: [https://django-starter-buttercms-demo.herokuapp.com/](https://django-starter-buttercms-demo.herokuapp.com/)

This Django starter project fully integrates with dynamic sample content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, categories, and tags, and all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created in your account dashboard when you 
[sign up for a free trial](https://buttercms.com/join/) of ButterCMS.
